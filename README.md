# Typewriter

A simple program for writing novels, poems and books.

## Author

My name is Roman Janků and currently I am a student at Faculty of Electrical Engineering at
Czech Technical University in Prague. In my free time I write mostly poems, but some novels as 
well and because of that I had a need to create this program. I wasn't happy with what other novel
writing software has to offer, so I decided to create my own. I decided to publish since other
people might find it useful for their novels.

## Technologies

This program is written solely in Java with some occasional HTML because of documentation. I used Open JDK 11, but it 
can be compiled in any newer version of Java from any other developer. However, I am not so sure about older versions of 
Java since I use a lot of newer features, but after some modification it could run on older Java. For writing the source
code I use IntelliJ Idea, but any other IDE or text editor will surely do the job.
