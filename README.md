# Typewriter

A simple program for writing novels, poems and books.

## Author

My name is Roman Janků and currently I am a student at Faculty of Electrical Engineering at
Czech Technical University in Prague. In my free time I write mostly poems, but some novels as 
well. However, I wasn't happy with what other novel writing software has to offer, so I created 
my own. Then I decided to publish since other people might find it useful for their writing.
