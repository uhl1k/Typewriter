<h1>Help for typewriter</h1>

<p>
    <em>What is typewriter?</em>
</p>
<p>
    Typewriter is a simple program written in Java programming language. I wrote it because I wasn't happy with other novel and poem writing software. Then I decided to publish since other people might find it useful for their writing.
</p>

<p>
    Typewriter is a free software. This means you can modify it and/or distributed as you want. However, you have to keep the license, which <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GNU GeneralPublic License 3.0</a>, you have to state your changes, keep the program open-source and keep link to the original author, who is <a href="https://github.com/uhl1k">uhl1k</a> (Roman Janků).
</p>

<p>
    Source codes and other information about Typewriter can be found on its public <a href="https://github.com/uhl1k/Typewriter">GitHub</a> repository.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Who is author?</em>
</p>
<p>
    My name is Roman Janků and currently I am a student at Faculty of Electrical Engineering at Czech Technical University in Prague. In my free time I write mostly poems, but some novels as well and I also play acoustic guitar.

<h2 id="create">Create a new file</h2>

<p>
    When you start the Typewriter you already have a new file created. However, if you have another file already opened, you need to create new file manually. Go to <em>File</em> menu and click on <em>Open</em> option. If you have any unsaved changes, the program will ask you if you want to save them. Then a list of books and chapters and poems and the editing area will be cleaned. At this point you have a new file opened. But be careful, this file is only in RAM memory. You need to save it to keep the data after you close the Typewriter.
